Coherent broadband dispersive wavetrains clearly emerge with group velocities similar to those predicted from the global Rayleigh-wave tomographic maps that have been constrained using ballistic surface waves. Those results show that coherent Rayleigh waves can be extracted from the ambient seismic noise and that their dispersion characteristics can be measured in a broad range of periods.

	abstract = {We study the origin of the background seismic noise averaged over long time by cross correlating of the vertical component of motion, which were first normalized by 1-bit coding. We use 1 year of recording at several stations of networks located in North America, western Europe, and Tanzania. We measure normalized amplitudes of Rayleigh waves reconstructed from correlation for all available station to station paths within the networks for positive and negative correlation times to determine the seasonally averaged azimuthal distribution of normalized background energy flow ({NBEF}) through the networks. We perform the analysis for the two spectral bands corresponding to the primary (10–20 s) and secondary (5–10 s) microseism and also for the 20–40 s band. The direction of the {NBEF} for the strongest spectral peak between 5 and 10 s is found to be very stable in time with signal mostly coming from the coastline, confirming that the secondary microseism is generated by the nonlinear interaction of the ocean swell with the coast. At the same time, the {NBEF} in the band of the primary microseism (10–20 s) has a very clear seasonal variability very similar to the behavior of the long-period (20–40 s) noise. This suggests that contrary to the secondary microseism, the primary microseism is not produced by a direct effect of the swell incident on coastlines but rather by the same process that generates the longer-period noise. By simultaneously analyzing networks in California, eastern United States, Europe, and Tanzania we are able to identify main source regions of the 10–20 s noise. They are located in the northern Atlantic and in the northern Pacific during the winter and in the Indian Ocean and in southern Pacific during the summer. These distributions of sources share a great similarity with the map of average ocean wave height map obtained by {TOPEX}-Poseidon. This suggests that the seismic noise for periods larger than 10 s is clearly related to ocean wave activity in deep water. The mechanism of its generation is likely to be similar to the one proposed for larger periods, namely, infragravity ocean waves.},

	abstract = {Ambient noise tomography is a rapidly emerging field of seismological research. This paper presents the current status of ambient noise data processing as it has developed over the past several years and is intended to explain and justify this development through salient examples. The ambient noise data processing procedure divides into four principal phases: (1) single station data preparation, (2) cross-correlation and temporal stacking, (3) measurement of dispersion curves (performed with frequency–time analysis for both group and phase speeds) and (4) quality control, including error analysis and selection of the acceptable measurements. The procedures that are described herein have been designed not only to deliver reliable measurements, but to be flexible, applicable to a wide variety of observational settings, as well as being fully automated. For an automated data processing procedure, data quality control measures are particularly important to identify and reject bad measurements and compute quality assurance statistics for the accepted measurements. The principal metric on which to base a judgment of quality is stability, the robustness of the measurement to perturbations in the conditions under which it is obtained. Temporal repeatability, in particular, is a significant indicator of reliability and is elevated to a high position in our assessment, as we equate seasonal repeatability with measurement uncertainty. Proxy curves relating observed signal-to-noise ratios to average measurement uncertainties show promise to provide useful expected measurement error estimates in the absence of the long time-series needed for temporal subsetting.},

We compare waveform convergence of short duration {NCF} stacks (e.g. 2, 5, 15 and 50 d stacks) towards the long-term (365 d) {NCF} stack. We observe short duration {NCF} improvement when applying Welch's method for non–pre-processed and running normalized time-series and short duration {NCF} degradation when applied to a ‘one-bit’ normalized time-series. Surprisingly, non–pre-processed time-series provides the quickest convergence to a robust (year-long) {NCF}. Because of the simplicity of Welch's method, the improved {NCF} convergence and a minimal increase in computation, we recommend applying Welch's method for future ambient seismic field analyses. Using this approach will likely improve future {NCF} analyses, particularly for studies with limited duration recordings, high levels of intermittent local or site noise and studies attempting to evaluate temporal variations in subsurface structure.},

The method presented can easily be extended to phase-weighted cross-correlations or be applied in the τp domain. We illustrate and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of {PWS} in comparison with other coherency measures and present examples.

All available three-component time-series for the 12-month span between 2005 November 1 and 2006 October 31 have been cross-correlated to yield estimated empirical Rayleigh and Love wave Green's functions. The Love wave signals were observed with higher average signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) than Rayleigh wave signals and hence cannot be fully explained by the scattering of Rayleigh waves. Phase velocity dispersion curves for both Rayleigh and Love waves between 5 and 40 speriod were measured for each interstation path by applying frequency–time analysis. The average uncertainty and systematic bias of the measurements are estimated using a method based on analysing thousands of nearly linearly aligned station-triplets. We find that empirical Green's functions can be estimated accurately from the negative time derivative of the symmetric component ambient noise cross-correlation without explicit knowledge of the source distribution. The average traveltime uncertainty is less than 1 s at periods shorter than 24 s. We present Rayleigh and Love wave phase speed maps at periods of 8, 12, 16,and 20 s. The maps show clear correlations with major geological structures and qualitative agreement with previous results based on Rayleigh wave group speeds.},

Phase velocities derived in this way at several frequencies are joined to form a dispersion curve, which is then sampled to obtain phase-velocity estimates at arbitrary frequencies. We collect a set of dispersion curves for more than 30,000 station pairs of the transportable component of {USArray}, and derive Rayleigh wave phase-velocity maps at periods of 12 and 24 s for the western United States.

The level of daily excitation of this 'hum' is equivalent to that of magnitude 5.75 to 6.0 earthquakes, which cannot be explained by summing the contributions of small earthquakes. As slow or silent earthquakes have been ruled out as a source for the hum (except in a few isolated cases), turbulent motions in the atmosphere or processes in the oceans have been invoked as the excitation mechanism. We have developed an array-based method to detect and locate sources of the excitation of the hum. Our results demonstrate that the Earth's hum originates mainly in the northern Pacific Ocean during Northern Hemisphere winter, and in the Southern oceans during Southern Hemisphere winter. We conclude that the Earth's hum is generated by the interaction between atmosphere, ocean and sea floor, probably through the conversion of storm energy to oceanic infragravity waves that interact with seafloor topography.},

In their Perspective, Kedar and Webb review advances reported at a recent meeting toward understanding the origins of this hum (which is referred to as ocean microseisms) and utilizing it in Earth science applications. For example, ocean microseisms can be used to assess El {NiÃ}±o conditions for times when few ocean data were available. They can also be used to monitor temporal changes in Earth's upper crust that cannot be detected with conventional seismology methods. Space- and airborne instruments may help to identify more clearly those regions where ocean microseisms are generated.},

	abstract = {We measure direction and amplitude of ocean-generated continuous seismic noise in the western United States. Slowness direction of the noise is determined using array beamforming, and particle motion direction from individual three-component stations. We find two surprising results. First, the noise is highly monodirectional at all sites, regardless of coastal distance. A single narrow generation area dominates for most of the time period, interrupted by a second well defined direction during ocean swell events. Second, we find that a storm off the Labrador coast with not unusual wave heights generates coherent noise across the entire continent. We show the causal relationship between swells arriving at different North American coastal areas and the triggered microseisms in time-lapse movies (Animations 1 and 2) of ocean swells and concurrent microseisms. Our results have a number of implications for different fields of research. A useful by-product of our finding that microseisms are a strongly directional noise source is the possibility of using automated processing of the continuous noise as a near real-time check on station polarity and calibration problems, which would be a simply implemented indicator for the state of health of a seismic network. Consistent monodirectional noise may have an influence on seismic azimuthal measurements such as shear wave splitting. Most importantly, our findings should be taken into account in proposed studies which will use seismic noise as a proxy for ocean wave height in investigations of interdecadal climate change.},

The group velocities and other dispersion parameters determined by this technique are concordant with theoretical values when the method is tested with synthetic seismograms. It can recover broader portions of the dispersion present in ordinary seismic recordings compared to the classical peak and trough method. A simple diagnostic diagram is introduced in order to study the time and frequency resolution permitted by this analytic technique.},

	abstract = {The development of global surface wave tomography using earthquakes has been crucial to exploration of the dynamic status of Earth’s deep. It is naturally believed that only large earthquakes can generate long-period seismic waves that penetrate deep enough into Earth for such exploration. The discovery of seismic hum, Earth’s background free oscillations, which are randomly generated by oceanic and/or atmospheric disturbances, now provides an alternative approach. We present results of global upper-mantle seismic tomography using seismic hum and without referring to earthquakes. At periods of 100 to 400 seconds, the phase-velocity anomalies of Rayleigh waves are measured by modeling the observed cross-correlation functions between every pair of stations from among 54 globally distributed seismic stations. The anomalies are then inverted to obtain the three-dimensional S-wave velocity structure in the upper mantle. Our technique provides a new means for exploring the three-dimensional structure of the interior of terrestrial planets with an atmosphere and/or oceans, particularly Mars.
Long-period surface waves from oceanic or atmospheric disturbances can be used for seismic mapping of the upper mantle.

Correlograms are then stacked using the time–frequency phase-weighted stack method to build-up empirical Green's functions. Group velocities and uncertainties are measured in the wide period band of 30–250 s, following a resampling approach. Less data are required to extract reliable group velocities at short periods than at long periods, and 2 yr of data are necessary to measure reliable group velocities for the entire period band. Group velocities are first regionalized and then inverted versus depth using a simulated annealing method in which the number and shape of splines that describes the S-wave velocity model are variable. The new S-wave velocity tomographic model is well correlated with models derived from earthquakes in most areas, although in India, the Dharwar craton is shallower than in other published models.},

	abstract = {Seismic interferometry involves the crosscorrelation of responses at different receivers to obtain the Green’s function between these receivers. For the simple situation of an impulsive plane wave propagating along the  xx{\textless}math overflow="scroll" display="inline"{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}x{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} -axis, the crosscorrelation of the responses at two receivers along the  xx{\textless}math overflow="scroll" display="inline"{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}x{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} -axis gives the Green’s function of the direct wave between these receivers. When the source function of the plane wave is a transient (as in exploration seismology) or a noise signal (as in passive seismology), then the crosscorrelation gives the Green’s function, convolved with the autocorrelation of the source function. Direct-wave interferometry also holds for 2D and 3D situations, assuming the receivers are surrounded by a uniform distribution of sources. In this case, the main contributions to the retrieved direct wave between the receivers come from sources in Fresnel zones around stationary points. The main application of direct-wave interferometry is theretrieval of seismic surface-wave responses from ambient noise and the subsequent tomographic determination of the surface-wave velocity distribution of the subsurface. Seismic interferometry is not restricted to retrieving direct waves between receivers. In a classic paper, Claerbout shows that the autocorrelation of the transmission response of a layered medium gives the plane-wave reflection response of that medium. This is essentially 1D reflected-wave interferometry. Similarly, the crosscorrelation of the transmission responses, observed at two receivers, of an arbitrary inhomogeneous medium gives the 3D reflection response of that medium. One of the main applications of reflected-wave interferometry is retrieving the seismic reflection response from ambient noise and imaging of the reflectors in the subsurface. A common aspect of direct- and reflected-wave interferometry is that virtual sources are created at positions where there are only receivers without requiring knowledge of the subsurface medium parameters or of the positions of the actual sources.},
