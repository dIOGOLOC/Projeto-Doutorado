	abstract = {Ambient seismic noise correlations are widely used for high-resolution surface-wave imaging of Earth’s lithosphere. Similar observations of the seismic body waves that propagate through the interior of Earth would provide a window into the deep Earth. We report the observation of the mantle transition zone through noise correlations of P waves as they are reflected by the discontinuities associated with the top [410 kliometers (km)] and the bottom (660 km) of this zone. Our data demonstrate that high-resolution mapping of the mantle transition zone is possible without using earthquake sources.
Correlated seismic waves reveal that the mantle boundary at 410 kilometers is three times the thickness of the deeper one at 660 kilometers.
