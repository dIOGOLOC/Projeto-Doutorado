	abstract = {The deformation of intraplate lithosphere in response to laterally applied stress has been investigated using a mathematical model of the elastic, brittle and viscous response of the lithosphere. Fundamental to the model is the conservation of the horizontal force associated with the applied stress and the redistribution of stress within the lithosphere after stress release by ductile or brittle failure. Ductile deformation is assumed to be controlled by dislocation creep in quartz in the crust and by dislocation and Dorn law creep in olivine in the mantle. Brittle failure is predicted using Griffith theory. The redistribution of stress after brittle and ductile deformation results in large levels of stress in the middle and lower crust immediately above the elastic-ductile or brittle-ductile transition. Lithosphere deformation is controlled critically by the lithosphere thermal structure of which surface heat flow, q, is taken as a convenient indicator. For hotter lithosphere, stress release by ductile deformation in the middle and lower lithosphere is more extensive and rapidly leads to larger levels of stress in the upper lithosphere. For sufficiently large levels of applied stress, or sufficiently hot lithosphere, complete failure (Whole Lithosphere Failure of the lithosphere occurs by ductile and brittle deformation resulting in geologically significant strains. Critical levels of applied stress required to produce Whole Lithosphere Failure have been computed as a function of the lithosphere surface heat flow. The predicted strength of the lithosphere has been compared with expected levels of intraplate stress arising from plate boundary forces and isostatically compensated loads. The model predicts significant extensional intraplate deformation in regions of moderate heat flow with q {\textgreater} 60 m W m−2. For compressional deformation, however, a hotter lithosphere is required with q {\textgreater} c. 75 m W m−2. The model predictions are in general agreement with the comparatively widespread occurrence of extensional intraplate deformation and the restricted occurrence of compressional deformation. The model has also been used to investigate the relationship between the depth of the brittle-ductile transition and lithosphere temperature structure. The brittle-ductile transition depth is shown to become shallower with increasing heat flow, in good agreement with seismic evidence.},

	abstract = {The intraplate deformation of continental lithosphere in response to applied stress has been investigated using a mathematical model which incorporates the elastic, ductile and brittle response of lithosphere material. Ductile deformation is assumed to be controlled in the crust by dislocation creep in quartz, and in the mantle by dislocation creep and plasticity in olivine. Brittle failure is predicted using modified Griffith theory. A fundamental feature of the model is the redistribution of stress within the lithosphere following stress release by both ductile and brittle deformation. This redistribution produces high levels of stress in the middle or lower crust immediately above the elastic-ductile or brittle-ductile transition.
Lithosphere deformation is shown to be critically dependent on the temperature structure of which surface heat flow is a convenient indicator. For higher geothermal gradients, the release of stress in the lower lithosphere by ductile deformation is more rapid and complete and results in large stress levels in the upper lithosphere. For sufficiently large applied stresses or steep geothermal gradients, the stress levels in the upper and middle crust will cause complete fracture of the upper lithosphere. Whole lithosphere failure (WLF) then results, by continued brittle and ductile deformation, causing geologically significant strains.
The critical value of applied stress required to give WLF has been calculated for both tensional and compressional deformation as a function of surface heat flow. The predicted lithosphere bulk strength is then compared with expected levels of intraplate stress arising from plate boundary forces and isostatically compensated loads, which are thought to give net stress levels in the continental lithosphere in the range +0.25 to -0.25 kB. Using these expected maximum stress levels, the model predicts significant extensional deformation in regions of moderate heat flow with q {\textgreater} c. 60mW m-2 (e.g. Central Europe) as well as for areas of high heat flow like the Basin- and-Range Province. Significant compressional deformation is predicted for areas of high heat flow with q {\textgreater} c. 75 mWm-2 but only for restricted conditions of stress combination. These results are in good agreement with the observed rather widespread incidence of extensional intraplate deformation and the restricted occurrence of compressional deformation which may be confined to areas of unusually high heat flow or weak crust.
The model may also be used to calculate the depth of the brittle-ductile transition which is shown to become shallower with increase in heat flow, in good agreement with seismic evidence.},
