	abstract = {We present a new global model for the Earth's crust based on seismic refraction data published in the period 1948–1995 and a detailed compilation of ice and sediment thickness. An extensive compilation of seismic refraction measurements has been used to determine the crustal structure on continents and their margins. Oceanic crust is modeled with both a standard model for normal oceanic crust, and variants for nonstandard regions, such as oceanic plateaus. Our model ({CRUST} 5.1) consists of 2592 5° × 5° tiles in which the crust and uppermost mantle are described by eight layers: (1) ice, (2) water, (3) soft sediments, (4) hard sediments, (5) crystalline upper, (6) middle, (7) lower crust, and (8) uppermost mantle. Topography and bathymetry are adopted from a standard database ({ETOPO}-5). Compressional wave velocity in each layer is based on field measurements, and shear wave velocity and density are estimated using recently published empirical Vp- Vs and Vp-density relationships. The crustal model differs from previous models in that (1) the thickness and seismic/density structure of sedimentary basins is accounted for more completely, (2) the velocity structure of unmeasured regions is estimated using statistical averages that are based on a significantly larger database of crustal structure, (3) the compressional wave, shear wave, and density structure have been explicitly specified using newly available constraints from field and laboratory studies. Thus this global crustal model is based on substantially more data than previous models and differs from them in many important respects. A new map of the thickness of the Earth's crust is presented, and we illustrate the application of this model by using it to provide the crustal correction for surface wave phase velocity maps. Love waves at 40 s are dominantly sensitive to crustal structure, and there is a very close correspondence between observed phase velocities at this period and those predicted by {CRUST} 5.1. We find that the application of crustal corrections to long-period (167 s) Rayleigh waves significantly increases the variance in the phase velocity maps and strengthens the upper mantle velocity anomalies beneath stable continental regions. A simple calculation of crustal isostacy indicates significant lateral variations in upper mantle density. The model {CRUST} 5.1 provides a complete description of the physical properties of the Earth's crust at a scale of 5° × 5° and can be used for a wide range of seismological and nonseismological problems.},

	abstract = {The Brazilian Lithosphere Seismic Project (BLSP, a joint project by University of São Paulo and Carnegie Institution, 1992– 1999) operated more than 20 temporary broadband stations in the southeastern Brazilian shield. The area, a transect 1000 km long and 300 km wide, covers different geological provinces: the Precambrian São Francisco craton, the adjacent Brasiliano(700 –500 Ma) fold belts, and the Paraná basin of Paleozoic origin. Crustal thicknesses were estimated for 23 sites using receiver functions. For each station, receiver functions were stacked for different sets of earthquakes according to azimuth and distance. The P-to-S Moho converted phase was clearly identified at most sites. Crustal thicknesses were estimated using an average crustal P wave velocity of 6.5 km/s. Poisson’s ratio of 0.23 (Vp/Vs = 1.70) was used for the São Francisco craton and adjacent fold belt (based on travel times from small, local earthquakes) and 0.25 was used for the Paraná basin and coastal belt. Crustal thicknesses ranged from 35 – 47 km. Although there is a clear inverse correlation between topography and Bouguer gravity anomalies in the study area, Moho depths show the opposite pattern from that expected: areas of low topography and less negative Bouguer anomalies, such as the Paraná basin, have thicker crust (40 –47 km) compared with the high elevation areas of the craton and fold belt (37 – 43 km). Two hypothesis are proposed to explain the data: (1) A lower density, by 30 –40 kg/m 3 , in the lithospheric mantle under the Archean block of the São Francisco craton relative to the Proterozoic lithosphere is responsible for maintaining the high elevations in the plateau area. Relatively low density and high P wave velocity are compatible with a depleted (low FeO) composition for the Archean lithosphere. (2) Alternatively, if the density contrasts between Archean and Proterozoic lithospheres are smaller than the values above, then the crust beneath the Paraná basin must be more dense than that of the craton. Higher crustal density and high Poisson’s ratio would be consistent with magmatic underplating in the lower crust beneath the Paraná basin, as inferred from other studies.},

	abstract = {The mountains across southern Norway and other margins of the North Atlantic Ocean appear conspicuously high in the absence of recent convergent tectonics. We investigate this phenomenon with receiver functions calculated for seismometers deployed across southern Fennoscandia. These are used to constrain the structure and seismic properties of the lithosphere and primarily to measure the thickness and infer the bulk composition of the crust. Such parameters are key to understanding crustal isostasy and assessing its role, or lack thereof, in supporting the observed elevations. Our study focuses on the southern Scandes mountain range that has an average elevation > 1.0 km above mean sea level. The crust–mantle boundary (Moho) is ubiquitously imaged, and we occasionally observe structures that may represent the base of the continental lithosphere or other thermal, chemical, or viscous boundaries in the upper mantle. The Moho resides at ∼ 25–30 km depth below mean sea level in southeastern coastal Norway and parts of Denmark, ∼ 35–45 km across the southern Scandes, and ∼ 50–60 km near the
Norwegian–Swedish border. That section of thickest crust coincides with much of the Transscandinavian Igneous Belt and often exhibits a diffuse conversion at the Moho, which probably results from the presence of a high wave speed, mafic lower crust across inner Fennoscandia. A zone of thinned crust ( < 35 km) underlies the Oslo Graben. Crustal Vp/Vs ratio measurements show trends that generally correlate with Moho depth; relatively high Vp/Vs occurs near the coast and areas affected by post-Caledonide rifting and lower Vp/Vs appears in older, unrifted crust across the southern Scandes. Our results indicate that most of the observed surface elevation in the southern Scandes is supported by an
Airy-like crustal root and potentially thin mantle lithosphere. To the east, where thicker crust and mantle lithosphere underlie low elevations, the presence of dense mafic lower crust fits a Pratt-like model for isostatic compensation. Because the Scandes mountains occupy the location of the ancient Caledonian orogeny, which created presumably much thicker crust and lithosphere by ca. 400 Ma, much of the dense lower crust or mantle lithosphere that is expected to form beneath large mountain belts must have been removed sometime afterwards to instill the current lithospheric architecture that underlies
the region.},

	abstract = {We investigate variations in crustal thickness and bulk {VP}/{VS} ratio across the Borborema Province of {NE} Brazil by analyzing teleseismic P-to-S conversions recorded at 52 seismic stations in the Province. The Borborema Province represents the western portion of a larger Neoproterozoic mobile belt that resulted from the assembly of Gondwanaland, and that split from the African continent during Mesozoic times. The evolution of the Province after continental breakup was marked by episodes of diffuse intraplate magmatism, perhaps leading to uplift of the Borborema Plateau in the Cenozoic. A number of geodynamic models have been proposed to explain coeval Cenozoic magmatism and uplift in the Province, which invoke either thermal anomalies under the Plateau and related mantle upwellings, channeling along lithospheric thin spots from a distant mantle plume, and small-scale convection at the continental edge. Alternatively, plateau uplift might have resulted from thickening of the crust after depth-dependent stretching of the continental lithosphere in the Mesozoic. Most of the models imply mafic underplating of the Plateau's crust in order to fully explain its elevated topography, but the volume of such mafic underplate varies among them. Our results show that: (i) the crust is 32–40 km thick under the Borborema Plateau, (ii) the crust is generally thinner – about 30–33 km – under the lower topographies surrounding the Plateau, and (iii) {VP}/{VS} ratios are in the 1.68–1.80 range for both regions of higher and lower topography. No apparent correlation is observed between {VP}/{VS} ratio and crustal thickness. Our results suggest that compositional differences between thick and thin crust across the Borborema Province are minimal, and that models of plateau uplift involving a small volume of mafic underplate provide a more plausible explanation for the observed topography of the Borborema Plateau.},

The crustal Poisson ratio can be determined from the joint analysis of the travel times of waves converted at the Moho and of crustal multiples reflected at the top of the Moho. We have analyzed the records of the permanent stations installed on the Australian continent, complemented by the data of the \{SKIPPY\} experiment. The results reveal substantial variations in the Poisson ratio in the different tectonic units. For the Proterozoic crust, an increase of the Poisson ratio with increasing crustal thickness is systematically observed while for the Phanerozoic crust, the Poisson ratio tends to decrease for increasing crustal thicknesses. These observations are in remarkable agreement with the results of the deep seismic soundings that were performed in the former Soviet Union. The variations observed in the Proterozoic provinces can perhaps be explained by underplating of mafic materials at the base of the crust. "

Emphasis was placed on obtaining high-accuracy velocity measurements, which are shown to be critical in calculating Poisson's ratios from velocities. The rocks have been divided into 29 major groups for which velocities, velocity ratios, and Poisson's ratios are presented at several
pressures. Observed Poisson's ratios for the monomineralic rocks compare favorably with theoretical Poisson's ratios calculated from
single-crystal elastic constants. Plagioclase feldspar composition is important in understanding rock Poisson's ratios, since Poisson's ratio of albite increases from 0.28 to a predicted value of 0.31 for
anorthite. Fe substitution for Mg in pyroxene and olivine also increases Poisson's ratio. Plotting rock compressional wave velocities versus Poisson's ratios reveals a triangular distribution bounded by quartzite with low compressional wave velocity and low Poisson's ratio, dunite with high compressional wave velocity and intermediate Poisson's ratio, and serpentinite with low compressional wave velocity and high Poisson's ratio. For common plutonic igneous rocks, there is a clear trend relating Poisson's ratio to composition, in which Poisson's ratio for granitic rocks increases from 0.24 to 0.29 as composition changes to gabbro and then decreases with decreasing plagioclase and increasing olivine contents to 0.25 in dunite. Changes in Poisson's ratio with progressive metamorphism of mafic and pelitic rocks correlate reasonably well with mineral reactions. There is no simple correlation between Poisson's ratio and felsic and mafic rock compositions; however, a linear correlation of increasing Poisson's ratio with decreasing {SiO}2 content is observed for rocks with 55 to 75 wt \% {SiO}2. Average Poisson's ratios for continental and oceanic crusts are estimated to be 0.265 and 0.30, respectively.},

The Receiver Function is obtained through the deconvolution of the horizontal component from the vertical one. The synthetic seismogram of the Receiver Function has a higher peak of direct P-waves, followed by minor peaks of Psc waves, where P converted into S in the upper-lower crust limit and multiple reflections. It was used the phase weighted slant-stacked method for the estimate of upper-crustal thickness and mb ratio. The best estimates are correctly stacked. The Normal Moveout correction for the Psc phase was used for the upper-crust thickness, simulating a vertical incidence. A total of 8 stations on the Borborema Province in the Brazilian Northeast was analyzed. The results show that there is an upper-lower crust limit in all the analyzed signs.

The method presented can easily be extended to phase-weighted cross-correlations or be applied in the τp domain. We illustrate and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of {PWS} in comparison with other coherency measures and present examples. We further show that our non-linear stacking technique enables us to detect a weak lower-mantle P-to-S conversion from a depth of approximately 840 km on array data.

Thin, 30 km thick, crust is present in the northern portion of Nevada and Utah despite elevations similar to those farther south. Crustal thickness across the Colorado Plateau can be characterized as a broad transitional region between the thin crust of Basin and Range to the thicker crust of the Rocky Mountains. The impedance contrast across the Mohorovicic discontinuity decreases below the Colorado Plateau, as converted arrivals recorded in this region appear weak compared to surrounding areas. Variations in {VP}/{VS} across the region indicate higher values along the western boundary of the Basin and Range, in the Rocky Mountains, and in the western Great Plains.

The Borborema Province represents the western portion of a larger Neoproterozoic mobile belt that experienced extension in the Mesozoic, leading to the formation of a number of intra-continental rift basins and, eventually, continental breakup. After continental breakup, episodes of uplift in the Province — perhaps related to coeval episodes of Cenozoic volcanism — helped shape the high topographies of the Borborema Plateau. Our receiver function {CCP} stacks image clear P-to-S conversions at the crust–mantle boundary and confirm independent evidence for a 36–38 km thick crust under the southern portion of the Plateau and a thinner 30–32 km thick crust in the surrounding regions, including the northern Plateau. The cross-sections also reveal the presence of an intra-crustal discontinuity at 9–18 km depth under the regions of thin crust that fades away under the thick southern Plateau. We argue that the thin crust in the Borborema Province is the result of Mesozoic crustal stretching and that the intra-crustal discontinuity represents a low-angle detachment zone that helped accommodate extension in the crust. The thick crust under the southern Plateau would then represent a rheologically stronger portion of the Borborema Province that resisted deformation by Mesozoic extension, while the thin crust under the northern Plateau would be a portion of formerly depressed thin crust that was uplifted during the Cenozoic.},

Crustal thicknesses derived from modelling gravity anomalies commonly depend on assumptions, such as constant density contrast across the Moho interface, which are not always easily verifiable and were considered only along the continental shelf to fill large gaps in the seismic data. Our compilation shows that the crust in the stable continental area onshore has an average thickness of 39 ± 5 km (1-σ deviation) and that no clear difference can be observed between low altitude, intracratonic sedimentary basins, {NeoProterozoic} foldbelts (except for the Borborema Province), and cratonic areas. The thinnest crust is found in the Borborema Province of {NE} Brazil (30–35 km) and along a narrow belt within Tocantins Province (∼35 km), roughly parallel to the Eastern border of the Amazon craton, while the thickest crust is found in the Amazon and São Francisco cratons (41 ± 4 km), and the Paraná Basin (42 ± 4 km). Both the Ponta Grossa and the Rio Grande Arches are areas of thinned crust, and the western border of the Brazilian platform, near the sub-Andean region, seems to be characterized by a crustal thickness of less than 40 km.

	abstract = {An extensive compilation of crustal thicknesses is used to develop crustal models in continental South America. We consider point crustal thicknesses from seismic refraction experiments, receiver function analyses, and surface-wave dispersion. Estimates of crustal thickness derived from gravity anomalies were only included along the continental shelf and in some areas of the Andes to fill large gaps in seismic coverage. Two crustal models were developed: A) by simple interpolation of the point estimates, and B) our preferred model, based on the same point estimates, interpolated with surface-wave tomography. Despite gaps in continental coverage, both models reveal interesting crustal thickness variations. In the Andean range, the crust reaches 75 km in Southern Peru and the Bolivian Altiplano, while crustal thicknesses seem to be close to the global continental average ({\textasciitilde} 40 km) in Ecuador and southern Colombia (despite high elevations), and along the southern Andes of Chile–Argentina (elevation lower than 2000 m). In the stable continental platform the average thickness is 38 ± 5 km (1-st. deviation) and no systematic differences are observed among Archean–Paleoproterozoic cratons, {NeoProterozoic} fold belts, and low-altitude intracratonic sedimentary basins. An exception is the Borborema Province ({NE} Brazil) with crust {\textasciitilde} 30–35 km thick. Narrow belts surrounding the cratons are suggested in central Brazil, parallel to the eastern and southern border of the Amazon craton, and possibly along the {TransBrasiliano} Lineament continuing into the Chaco basin, where crust thinner than 35 km is observed. In the sub-Andean region, between the mid-plate cratons and the Andean cordillera, the crust tends to be thinner ({\textasciitilde} 35 km) than the average crust in the stable platform, a feature possibly inherited from the old pre-Cambrian history of the continent. We expect that these crustal models will be useful for studies of isostasy, dynamic topography, and crustal evolution of the continent.},

	abstract = {Crustal structure in South America is one of the least understood among the Earth's continental areas. Variations in crustal thickness are still poorly constrained over large portions of the continent because of scarce or unevenly distributed crustal thickness estimates throughout South America. To address this scarce and inhomogeneous data cover we explore the possibility to derive crustal thickness from satellite gravity data. In this study, we utilize the combined gravity model {EIGEN}-6C, which is composed of {GOCE} and other gravity data. The Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer ({GOCE}) satellite has a much more uniform spatial resolution than any land-based gravity or seismic survey in South America. The gravity data inversion is for a simple two-layer model with fixed density contrast over the interface, the Moho. The method is not relying on point constraint data and assumes that all of the signal is related to topography of the Moho. Model quality can therefore be assessed by a comparison with point observations on crustal thickness. We show that for the stable part of the continent 90\% of our estimates are similar, within error bounds, to seismic observations. Variations occur in active orogenic zones or regions with suspected non-standard Moho density contrasts. A comparison with seismological models shows a high correlation with the most recent model. Especially in areas where continental and global models of crustal structure have limitations in terms of wave paths or point constraints the gravity based model provides a unique continuity of crustal structure providing new insights on structure and tectonics and increase our understanding of the Earth's structure underneath South America.},

Noise may produce spurious secondary arrivals that obscure or mimic arrivals produced by P-to-S conversions at large contrasts in seismic impedance such as the Moho. We use a Hilbert transform to calculate phase-weights, which minimize the constructive stacking of erroneous signal in receiver function data sets. We outline this approach and demonstrate its application through synthetic data combined with different types of noise, a previously published example of signal-generated noise, and a large data set from the Sierra Nevada {EarthScope} Project.

	abstract = {We implement a method to invert jointly teleseismic P-wave receiver functions and surface wave group and phase velocities for a mutually consistent estimate of earth structure. Receiver functions are primarily sensitive to shear wave velocity contrasts and vertical traveltimes, and surface wave dispersion measurements are sensitive to vertical shear wave velocity averages. Their combination may bridge resolution gaps associated with each individual data set. We formulate a linearized shear velocity inversion that is solved using a damped least-squares scheme that incorporates a priori smoothness constraints for velocities in adjacent layers. The data sets are equalized for the number of data points and physical units in the inversion process. The combination of information produces a relatively simple model with a minimal number of sharp velocity contrasts. We illustrate the approach using noise-free and realistic noise simulations and conclude with an inversion of observations from the Saudi Arabian Shield. Inversion results for station {SODA}, located in the Arabian Shield, include a crust with a sharp gradient near the surface (shear velocity changing from 1.8 to 3.5 km s−1 in 3 km) underlain by a 5-km-thick layer with a shear velocity of 3.5 km s−1 and a 27-km-thick layer with a shear velocity of 3.8 km s−1, and an upper mantle with an average shear velocity of 4.7 km s−1. The crust–mantle transition has a significant gradient, with velocity values varying from 3.8 to 4.7 km s−1 between 35 and 40 km depth. Our results are compatible with independent inversions for crustal structure using refraction data.},

We developed and applied a new method of simultaneously inverting regional S and Rayleigh waveforms and fundamental mode Rayleigh wave group velocities, to better constrain upper mantle S velocity structure and Moho depth. We used ∼5700 Rayleigh wave group velocity dispersion curves and 1537 regional wave trains with paths principally passing through the South American continent. The joint inversion of this data set provided a new three-dimensional (3-D) upper mantle S velocity model and a Moho depth model for South America, which fits both the group velocity and regional waveform data sets well. New features of the final three-dimensional (3-D) S velocity and Moho depth model correlate well with known geotectonic units on a regional scale. The Moho depth ranges from 30 km in the central Chaco basin to 42 km beneath the Amazonian craton and 45–70 km beneath the orogenic Andean belt. The imaged S velocity indicates an average lithosphere thickness of around 160 km for the Amazonian craton. High velocities are imaged beneath the Amazon and part of the Paraná and Parnaíba basins down to about 150 km. Low to very low velocities are imaged beneath the central Andes and the Chaco, Pantanal, and northwestern Paraná basins.},

The study area can be described as a typical Paleozoic intracratonic basin that hosts one of the largest Large Igneous Province of the world and makes a unique setting for investigating models of basin subsidence and their interaction with mantle plumes. Our study consists of (1) an analysis of the Moho interaction phases in the receiver functions to obtain the thickness and bulk Vp/Vs ratio of the basin`s underlying crust and (2) a joint inversion with Rayleigh-wave dispersion velocities from an independent tomographic study to delineate the detailed S-wave velocity variation with depth. The results of our analysis reveal that Moho depths and bulk Vp/Vs ratios (including sediments) vary between 41 and 48 km and between 1.70 and 1.76, respectively, with the largest values roughly coinciding with the basin`s axis, and that S-wave velocities in the lower crust are generally below 3.8 km/s. Select sites within the basin, however, show lower crustal S-wave velocities slightly above 3.9 km/s suggestive of underplated mafic material. We show that these observations are consistent with a fragmented cratonic root under the Parana basin that defined a zone of weakness for the initial Paleozoic subsidence of the basin and which allowed localized mafic underplating of the crust along the suture zones by Cenozoic magmatism.},

	abstract = {The number of broadband three-component seismic stations in southern California has more than tripled recently. In this study we use the teleseismic receiver function technique to determine the crustal thicknesses and Vp/Vs ratios for these stations and map out the lateral variation of Moho depth under southern California. It is shown that a receiver function can provide a very good “point” measurement of crustal thickness under a broadband station and is not sensitive to crustal P velocity. However, the crustal thickness estimated only from the delay time of the Moho P-to-S converted phase trades off strongly with the crustal Vp/Vs ratio. The ambiguity can be reduced significantly by incorporating the later multiple converted phases, namely, the {PpPs} and {PpSs}+{PsPs}. We propose a stacking algorithm which sums the amplitudes of receiver function at the predicted arrival times of these phases by different crustal thicknesses H and Vp/Vs ratios. This transforms the time domain receiver functions directly into the H-Vp/Vs domain without need to identify these phases and to pick their arrival times. The best estimations of crustal thickness and Vp/Vs ratio are found when the three phases are stacked coherently. By stacking receiver functions from different distances and directions, effects of lateral structural variation are suppressed, and an average crustal model is obtained. Applying this technique to 84 digital broadband stations in southern California reveals that the Moho depth is 29 km on average and varies from 21 to 37 km. Deeper Mohos are found under the eastern Transverse Range, the Peninsular Range, and the Sierra Nevada Range. The central Transverse Range, however, does not have a crustal root. Thin crusts exist in the Inner California Borderland (21–22 km) and the Salton Trough (22 km). The Moho is relatively flat at the average depth in the western and central Mojave Desert and becomes shallower to the east under the Eastern California Shear Zone ({ECSZ}). Southern California crust has an average Vp/Vs ratio of 1.78, with higher ratios of 1.8 to 1.85 in the mountain ranges with Mesozoic basement and lower ratios in the Mojave Block except for the {ECSZ}, where the ratio increases.},

	abstract = {Teleseismic long-period P waves recorded at the World-Wide Standard Seismograph Network station {LON} (Longmire, Washington) are shown to exhibit strong anomalous particle motion not attributable to instrument miscalibration or malfunction. In particular, a large and azimuthally smoothly varying tangential component is observed after vector rotation of horizontal P waves into the ray direction and after application of a deconvolution technique which equalizes effective source time functions and removes the instrument response. These tangential waves attain amplitudes comparable to the radial component and demonstrate wave form antisymmetry about a {NNE} azimuth. A model which contains a single high-contrast interface dipping toward the {NNE} at a depth of 15–20 km can explain most of the characteristics of the long-period P wave data, provided dips are greater than about 10° and only the interference of P and Ps generated at the interface is considered. The model breaks down for later arrivals which are presumably multiples or scattered waves. Examination of long-period S waves from several deep teleseisms shows a prominent Sp arrival 18 s before S. The timing of this phase conversion suggests an interface at about 145-km depth, and its sense of polarity suggests that the velocity contrast is from higher to lower velocities as depth decreases. This interface may correspond to the bottom of the upper mantle low-velocity zone in the area.},

The {\textasciitilde}3 km thick, Phanerozoic sedimentary section overlies a pronounced, planar, regional unconformity that crosses three Precambrian blocks with differing seismic facies: the Amazonian/Araguaia block, the Parnaíba block, and the Borborema block. The blocks are separated by steep crustal-scale boundaries across which seismic facies change abruptly. In the west, the ophiolitic metasedimentary rocks of the Araguaia Group overlie the Amazonian craton.

A second crustal boundary defines the eastern margin of the Parnaíba block with the Neoproterozoic Borborema block. This boundary is interpreted as the extension of the Transbrasiliano shear zone. These data demonstrate that the basement of the Parnaíba basin was formed during Brasiliano orogenesis by west directed collision-related thrusting, succeeded by lateral accretion along steep, crustal-scale boundaries. After formation of a post-Brasiliano peneplain, the Parnaíba basin developed seamlessly across three very different crustal blocks and appears to have been significantly larger than its present outline. No extensive underlying rift system is evident suggesting that basement structure had little to do with basin formation, but that episodic reactivation of the boundary zones and basement fabric has controlled the structuring and preservation of the basin.},

Airborne gravity and magnetic data were modeled to reveal the general

that gravity and magnetic signatures delineate the main boundaries and
structural trends of three cratonic areas and surrounding Neoproterozoic

crust. Forward modeling of gravity and magnetic data indicates that
lateral boundaries between crustal units are limited by Brasiliano shear
zones, representing lithospheric sutures of the Amazonian and São

	abstract = {Neoproterozoic geologic and geotectonic processes were of utmost importance in forming and structuring the basement framework of the South-American platform. Two large domains with distinct evolutionary histories are identified with respect to the Neoproterozoic era: the northwest-west (Amazonian craton and surroundings) and the central-southeast (the extra-Amazonian domain).

In the first domain, Neoproterozoic events occurred only locally and were of secondary significance, and the geologic events, processes, and structures of the pre-Neoproterozoic (and syn-Brasiliano) cratonic block were much more influential. In the second, the extra-Amazonian domain, the final evolution, structures and forms are assigned to events related to the development of a complex net of Neoproterozoic mobile belts. These in turn resulted in strong reworking of the older pre-Neoproterozoic basement. In this domain, four distinct structural provinces circumscribe or are separated by relatively small pre-Neoproterozoic cratonic nuclei, namely the Pampean, Tocantins, Borborema and Mantiqueira provinces. These extra-Amazonian provinces were formed by a complex framework of orogenic branching systems following a diversified post-Mesoproterozoic paleogeographic scenario. This scenario included many types of basement inliers as well as a diversified organization of accretionary and collisional orogens. The basement inliers date from the Archean to Mesoproterozoic periods and are different in nature. The escape tectonics that operated during the final consolidation stages of the provinces were important to and responsible for the final forms currently observed. These latest events, which occurred from the Late Ediacaran to the Early Ordovician, present serious obstacles to paleogeographic reconstructions.

Two groups of orogenic collage systems are identified. The older system from the Tonian (\&gt;850 Ma) period is of restricted occurrence and is not fully understood due to strong reworking subsequent to Tonian times. The second group of orogenies is more extensive and more important. Its development began with diachronic taphrogenic processes in the Early Cryogenian period (ca. 850–750 Ma) and preceded a complex scenario of continental, transitional and oceanic basins. Subsequent orogenies (post 800 Ma) were also created by diachronic processes that ended in the Early Ordovician. More than one orogeny (plate interaction) can be identified either in space or in time in every province. The orogenic processes were not necessarily synchronous in different parts of the orogenic system, even within the same province. This particular group of orogenic collage events is known as the “Brasiliano”.

All of the structural provinces of the extra-Amazonian domain exhibit final events that are marked by extrusion processes, are represented by long lineaments, and are fundamental to unraveling the structural history of the Phanerozoic sedimentary basins.},

	abstract = {The territory of Brazil coincides almost entirely with the South American Platform, the crystalline core of the continent. Its basement is composed of ancient metamorphic and igneous rocks and it has not suffered any tectonic regeneration since the beginning of the
Phanerozoic. Sedimentary rocks with almost horizontal bedding cover this crystalline basement. This latter shows ages as old as Early
Precambrian, although ages between 500 and 1000 m.y. are conspicuously frequent. The cratonic areas became consolidated more than 1700 m.y. ago, whereas the fold belts formed essentially between 500 and 1700 m.y. ago. The sedimentary cover accumulated from the Early Silurian in three large intracratonic basins, until the platform became completely stabilized. A Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous reactivation, caused by the break-up of the ancient Gondwana continent, created another basin sequence chiefly along the Atlantic continental margin. Based on the nature of the crystalline basement rocks and the sedimentary cover, ten structural provinces can be distinguished: Rio Branco Province, in the north of the country, occupied by the Guyana Shield and still only poorly known, with an important fold belt developed during the so-called Transamazonian Cycle (2000 ± 200m.y.) with high-grade metamorphic rocks and only slight influence of later events.

Tapajós Province, in central Brazil, corresponding to the
Amazonas or {GuaporéCraton}, showing chiefly Precambrian
crystalline rocks and behaving as an cratonic area during the
Phanerozoic.

Sa˜o Francisco Province, located on the Atlantic Shield, with its basement covered by rocks of different ages, chiefly affected by the Brasiliano Cycle (between 1000 and 500 m.y.) and constituting another cratonic area.

Tocantins Province, between the Amazonas and Sa˜o Francisco
Cratons, with the oldest rocks in its centre (ages over 2600 m.y.), and at the eastern and western borders metamorphic sequences of various fold belts, and almost no Phanerozoic deposits.

Mantiqueira Province, located along the southern part of the Atlantic coast, affected chiefly by the Brasiliano folding cycle.

Borborema Province, in the northeast Brazilian fold belt, affected by the Brasiliano Cycle in a very complex way, and with important faulted zones. It was reactivated in Phanerozoic times, when also sedimentary covers accumulated.

Amazonas Province, represented by the Amazonas sedimentary basin (syneclise), and subdivided into four parts by three important arcs.

Parnaiba Province, coinciding with the Piauf — Maranha˜o
syneclise, and filled with a rather thick sedimentary sequence.

{ParanáProvince}, the sedimentary basin of southern Brazil, in
which the well-known Late Paleozoic glaciation features are found, and which possesses an extensive cover of basaltic rocks of Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age.

Coastal Province and Continental Margin, the youngest structural unit, developed during the separation of the continent and represented by rift-valleys and coastal basins filled with Mesozoic-Cenozoic deposits of various kinds.},

A 3D lithospheric S-velocity model of South America was obtained by first carrying out Rayleigh and Love wave group-velocity tomography, and then inverting the regionalized dispersion curves. Fundamental mode group velocities were measured using a Multiple Filtering Technique. More than 12,000 paths were examined and about 6000 Rayleigh- and 3500 Love-wave dispersion curves with good quality were retrieved. Checkerboard tests showed that our dataset permits the resolution of features 400–800 km across laterally in the central part of the continent from crustal to upper mantle depths. Our results confirm previous tomographic results and correlate well with the major geological provinces of South America. The 3D S-velocity model confirms both regional features of {SE} Brazil from P-wave travel-time tomography and continental-scale features of central and western South America from waveform inversion, e.g., lowest velocities in the Andean upper mantle; three parts of the Nazca plate with flat subduction; strong low-velocity anomalies in the upper-mantle depth beneath the Chaco basin. Furthermore, our 3D model revealed new features in the South American continent: (1) high velocities in the lower crust were consistently found in regions with high Bouguer or free-air anomalies; (2) the {NE}–{SW} trending {TransBrasiliano} shear zone was delineated by a {NE}–{SW} low-velocity belt at lithospheric depths; (3) the eastern Amazonian craton appears to have thicker lithosphere than the western craton; (4) in areas of Archean nuclei located in the northeastern Guaporé shield and southeastern São Francisco craton, high velocity anomalies were found down to 150 km.},

To this end, we analyzed receiver functions from 20 relatively new temporary broadband seismic stations deployed across eastern Brazil. In the analysis we include teleseismic and some regional events, particularly for stations that recorded few suitable earthquakes. We first estimate crustal thickness and average Poisson's ratio using two different stacking methods. We then combine the new crustal constraints with results from previous receiver function studies. To interpolate the crustal thickness between the station locations, we jointly invert these Moho point constraints, Rayleigh wave group velocities, and regional S and Rayleigh waveforms for a continuous map of Moho depth. The new tomographic Moho map suggests that Moho depth and Moho relief vary slightly with age within the Precambrian crust. Whether or not a positive correlation between crustal thickness and geologic age is derived from the pre-interpolation point constraints depends strongly on the selected subset of receiver functions. This implies that using only pre-interpolation point constraints (receiver functions) inadequately samples the spatial variation in geologic age. The new Moho map also reveals an anomalously deep Moho beneath the oldest core of the Amazonian Craton.},

	abstract = {The basement of the South American platform consists of two large distinct geologic domains: the Amazonian or pre-Tonian (N-{NW} portions) and the “Brasiliano” (or “Extra-Amazonian”, the central and eastern portions). These domains are separated by a set of two long linear fault zones, the Transbrasiliano lineament ({NNE}-{SSW}) to the south and the Araguaia lineament ({NS}) to the north.The Amazonian domain consists of large Archaean nuclei surrounded by Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic mobile belts of all of the systems of these eras. These mobile belts strike {NNW}-{SSE}, with indications of crustal growth from {NNE} to {SSW}, as recorded by the belts themselves as well as by subsequent anorogenic plutonism and cratonic covers. The western portion of the Amazonian domain and the basement inliers of the Andean orogenic belt present important affinities in terms of composition and crustal evolution. Most of the general framework and most of the Amazonian domain are akin to those recorded to the north in the Laurentian continent.The Brasiliano domain records a complex orogenic collage, representing branching systems of orogens, dated from tectonic cycles of the Tonian up to the Early Ordovician. This domain includes several minor cratonic nuclei formed of Archaean and Paleoproterozoic rock units, amalgamated by fold belts generated during (at least) five Wilsonian orogenic cycles. Crustal growth follows different centripetal processes because the vergences of the belts are towards the small cratonic nuclei. Aside from the cratons, several other pre-Neoproterozoic terranes were also amalgamated, and submitted to strong tectonic-thermal reactivations. Mesoproterozoic mobile belts have not been detected yet. The few geological records known from the Statherian and from the Mesoproterozoic were reset during the Neoproterozoic tectonism. At the end of the Neoproterozic orogenic cycles, a striking post-collisional scenario led by extrusional tectonics was in place. These processes reshaped the final structural framework of the Brasiliano provinces, distinguishing them from the Amazonian domain. The Brasiliano domain displays many compositional, structural and crustal evolution affinities with those of the westernmost part of the African continent.The more than 4500km long {NNE}-{SSW} Transbrasiliano lineament is the main record of the extrusional processes (from ca. 540Ma onwards) and displays evidence of seismic and faulting activities along the Phanerozoic. The Araguaia lineament is the final record of orogeny and collision, as the result of interactions between the Amazonian craton/plate and the backlands situated to the east in Neoproterozoic times (Colméia-Xambioá, Paranaiba and Granja terranes are good candidates).},

Combined geological and geochronological information indicate that the Paleoproterozoic rocks are part of a Trans-Amazonian/Eburnean orogen initiated by an accretionary phase (2240–2150 Ma), better represented in the adjacent São Luís Craton, and terminated by collisional event (2100–2080 Ma) that amalgamated juvenile and reworked Paleoproterozoic terrains and an Archean terrain existing to the south. This landmass amalgamated in the Paleoproterozoic broke up before 732 Ma, forming a rift, as suggested by the emplacement of the nepheline syenite pluton. The rift received detritus coming from Archean, Paleoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic, and Neoproterozoic sources. We infer that the rift evolved to an oceanic basin and that the closure of this basin occurred at the end of the Neoproterozoic (580–550 Ma), as part of the Brasiliano/Pan-African cycle of orogenies},

	abstract = {The use of broadband receiver function analysis to estimate the fine-scale S-velocity structure of the lithosphere is becoming increasingly popular. A series of numerical experiments shows several important aspects of this technique, with emphasis on estimation of dipping interfaces. The recent modification introduced to the receiver function analysis technique that preserves absolute amplitudes (Ammon, 1991) is more robust than the previous technique of modeling receiver functions that were normalized to unit amplitude. Using the latter method, shallow (e.g., depths less than ∼2 km) high-velocity contrast interfaces may alter the apparent amplitudes of Ps phases and produce inaccuracies in the Earth model developed. The use of absolute amplitudes minimizes this potential for error. When research targets include deep dipping structure, tight stacking bounds (e.g., ≦ 10° in backazimuth ({BAZ}) and epicentral distance (Δ)) should be applied to avoid attenuating Ps phases and to aid in the identification of reverberations or scattered energy. Reverberations sample a relatively large lateral range about the recording site (e.g., a radius of 1 to 1.5 times the depth of the reflecting interface) and in the presence of dipping interfaces exhibit drastic variations in amplitude and arrival time as a function of {BAZ} and Δ. Thus, they cannot readily be used to provide constraints on the Earth structure. Formal inversion techniques, which attempt to match all arrivals in the waveform, must be used with caution when modeling receiver functions from complex regions. Only those phases whose amplitude and arrival-time variations as a function of {BAZ} and Δ are consistent with those of Ps conversions should be modeled. Forward modeling may resolve, depending upon the data quality and noise level, S-velocity contrasts greater than ∼ 0.2 to 0.4 km / sec. Layers of thickness 2 to 5 km may be accurately imaged, and transition zones may be examined by considering various frequency bands of the data. In order to better understand the resolving power of the data, the averaging functions associated with the receiver functions may be calculated from the observed data and, if desired, used in the forward modeling process.},
